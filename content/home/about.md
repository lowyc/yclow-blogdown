# Biography

<<<<<<< HEAD
I am a lecturer at the Department of Computing and Information Systems, School of Science and Technology, Sunway University, Selangor, Malaysia. I received my doctoral degree in Applied and Computational Statistics from University of Malaya in year 2016. The title of my doctoral thesis is "Some Families of Count Distributions for Modelling Zero-Inflation and Dispersion". I believe that statistics is an ubiquitous science, in the sense that it can be found and applied in various fields including (and not limiting to) computer science, medical science, finance, actuarial science, astronomy and engineering.

I maintain a broad interest in research work related to Statistics as a discipline, including but not limited to topics on discrete distributions and count processes, Monte Carlo methods, applied probabilistic models and statistics education.

I am a member of the Association for Computing Machinery since 2017 and International Statistical Institute  since 2018.
